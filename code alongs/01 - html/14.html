  <h1>Snakes</h1>
  <p>Snakes are some of the most feared animals, up there with spiders and centipedes for many. Some people even suffer from ophidiophobia, an intense fear of snakes. This fear is not unfounded. Our bodies have evolved to fear animals that could potentially harm us, and some snakes certainly can be deadly.</p>
